   <h3>Where The Mind Is Without Fear</h3>
     <p>
"Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high<br>
Where knowledge is free<br>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br>
By narrow domestic walls<br>
Where words come out from the depth of truth<br>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br>
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit<br>
Where the mind is led forward by thee<br>
Into ever-widening thought and action<br>
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake."<br></p>
